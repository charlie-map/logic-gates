# logic-gates
Playing around with logic gates. The main idea is to gain a better understanding of how some lower levels of computers work

# first test - addition:
  I started by just playing around and testing some different things, and then I went into pattern recognition mode where I purposefully looked at each different outcome of different cases and looked at them.
  From there I tried to just connect different things in order to get a correct connection for the first level
  
  The second level provided a much more challenging view, where I had this carry value coming in that would add another level of complexity to the function, which took some experimenting on both paper and Logisism.
  Initialized the first two levels relatively well, and any levels beyond rely on the same pattern as level two (the adder that's takes in the excess values of level one)
